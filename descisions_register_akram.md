# Different decisions made during this assignment

## Front-end

 - Use react
 - Use typescript
 - Deciding between using redux and react-query
    - initially decided on redux but
    - Using react-query because not enough complexity to justify using redux
 - using tailwind for css because bootstrap is the current library and don't wanna mess around with the design of the UI too much
 - splitting folders into domains clean architecture style in the front-end
 - using prettier over eslint
 - using .env for base uri location
